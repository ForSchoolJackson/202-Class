## Game Design

-   Camera Movement: The camera is stationary.
-   Player Health: Player startes with three hearts. When hit by a ghost, the player will lose a heart.

    -   Right: D key

## You Additions

I made all the sprites on my own.
The character, ghosts, bullets, were all drawn by me.
I also took time to animate the character walk cycle when the chracter moves.
This way it doesnt just glide across the screen, but instead walks.

## Sources

-All sprites (character, ghosts, bullet, background) were created by me in piskel.com  https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite

## Known Issues

There is an issue with the direction of the bullet firing where if a bullet is going one way on the screen and the player shoot a bulet the other way the direction of both will shoot the currect way the bullet was shot.

The hitboxes are a little bit too big.

The game sometimes gives the player a random game over, idk why.

There is rare issue that occurs that breaks the game, it might be fixed now. I cant tell how or when it happens, I just know it has happened a few times.

### Requirements not completed

I hopefully did them all.
I could have probably done more in the make it my own, by adding sounds.
